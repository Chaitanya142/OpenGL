3. Write a program to multiply 3 numbers and print on console.

4. Write a program to print maximum of two numbers.

5. Write a program to accept n nos from user and print all Odd numbers from those n Nos.

6. Write a program to accept n nos from user and print all Even numbers from those n Nos.

7. Write a program to accept numbers from user and show number line.
Note - Start number Line with negative i.e number given by user and print it starting from negative to positive.
Eg - -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4

8. Write a program to print ten multiples of a number accepted from user.
Eg -  2 then 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 

9. Write a program to accept n numbers from user and print addition of n numbers.

10.Write a program to accept n numbers from user and print maximum of n numbers.
Eg - 4 8 7 9 10 6 output - 10

11.Write a program to accept n numbers from user and print second last maximum number.
Eg - 4 8 7 9 10 6 output - 9

12.Write a program to check whether number is perfect number or not.
Eg - 6 output 6 is a perfect number.
Perfect number - a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, 
that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself 

13.Write a program to accept n numbers from user and check whether number is perfect number or not from that range.

14.Write a program to check whether number is prime number or not.
Eg - 5 output 5 is a prime number.

16. Write a program to accept 2 numbers from user and find power of that number.
Eg - 2 4 output - 16

17. Write a program to accept number from user and check whether number is armstrong number or not.
Eg - 153 output - 153 is a armstrong number

18. Write a program to accept number from user find factorial of a number.
Eg - 5 output - 120

For Digits Programs- 
no % 10 gives single digit eg - For 553, no % 10 gives 3
no / 10 reduces number by one eg - For 553, no / 10 gives 55

19. Write a program to accept number from user and count number of digits of a given number.
Eg - 1538 output - 4

20. Write a program to accept number from user and reverse that number.
Eg - 1538 output - 8351

21. Write a program to accept number from user and find generic root of that number.
Generic root - Generic root of a number is addition of digit of that number till we get single digit addition.

22.Accept a number from user and check whether addition of digits of that number is even or not.
